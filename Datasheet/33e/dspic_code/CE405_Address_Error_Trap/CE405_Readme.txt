1. Code Example Description:
----------------------------
Microchip's 16-bit dsPIC® Digital Signal Controllers feature an on-chip mechanism to detect software errors and 
take corrective action. Specifically, the ability to detect memory addressing errors is provided by means of 
automatic Address Error Trap detection. Memory addressing errors may be caused by one of the following:

a. A misaligned data word fetch is attempted. This condition occurs when an instruction performs a word 
   access with the LSb of the effective address set to ‘1’. The dsPIC33E CPU requires all word accesses to 
   be aligned to an even address boundary.

b. A bit manipulation instruction using the Indirect Addressing mode with the LSb of the effective address set to ‘1’.

c. A data fetch from unimplemented data address space is attempted.

d. Execution of a “BRA #literal” instruction or a “GOTO #literal” instruction, where literal is an unimplemented 
   program memory address.

e. Executing instructions after modifying the PC to point to unimplemented program memory addresses. 
   The PC may be modified by loading a value into the stack and executing a RETURN instruction.

If the application defines an Address Error Trap service routine (trap handler), the processor will vector to the 
trap handler when it detects an Address Error trap.


Note:
The user should note that the MPLAB® C30 C compiler will not intentionally generate any instructions that cause 
an address error trap to occur. The compiler/assembler will also detect address error instances in code whenever possible.

2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time start-up
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

d. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

e. h
        This folder contains include files for the code example.


f. src
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------
        a. Explorer 16 Demo board with dsPIC33EP512MU810 controller

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different dsPIC33E device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any dsPIC33E device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB® IDE to a dsPIC33E device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device

        b. Provide the correct device linker script and header file for your
        device. Device linker scripts and header files are available in your
        MPLAB® C30 installation folder under:
        Device Linker Script-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        Device C Header file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        Device ASM Include file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\inc

        c. Provide the appropriate path to your MPLAB C30 support file locations
        using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build Options>>Project

        d. Chose the development board applicable to your device. Some options
        are provided below:


        e. Re-build the MPLAB® project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        f. Download the hex file into the device and run.

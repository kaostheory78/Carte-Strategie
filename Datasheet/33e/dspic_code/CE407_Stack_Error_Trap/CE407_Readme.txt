1. Description:
---------------
Microchip's 16-bit dsPIC® Digital Signal Controllers feature a software stack, i.e., the stack is part of general 
purpose RAM. PUSH and POP instructions use the W15 register as a stack pointer to place variables on to the 
top of stack location or to unload variables from the top of stack location in RAM. 

The CPU also features a mechanism to detect software errors and take corrective action.

Specifically, the ability to detect over-utilization or under-utilization of the Stack is provided by 
means of automatic Stack Error Trap detection. Stack Errors may be caused by one of the following:

a. Stack Overflow - W15 is greater than the SPLIM register
b. Stack Underflow - W15 is lesser than the base address of RAM

If the application defines a Stack Error Trap service routine (trap handler), the processor will vector 
to the trap handler when it detects a Stack Error trap.



Note:
The user should note that the MPLAB® C30 C compiler will not intentionally generate any instructions 
that cause a stack error trap to occur.


2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time start-up
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

d. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

e. h
        This folder contains include files for the code example.


f. src
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------
        a. Explorer 16 Demo board with dsPIC33EP512MU810 controller

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different dsPIC33E device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any dsPIC33E device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB® IDE to a dsPIC33E device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device

        b. Provide the correct device linker script and header file for your
        device. Device linker scripts and header files are available in your
        MPLAB® C30 installation folder under:
        Device Linker Script-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        Device C Header file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        Device ASM Include file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\inc

        c. Provide the appropriate path to your MPLAB C30 support file locations
        using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build Options>>Project

        d. Chose the development board applicable to your device. Some options
        are provided below:


        e. Re-build the MPLAB® project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        f. Download the hex file into the device and run.
